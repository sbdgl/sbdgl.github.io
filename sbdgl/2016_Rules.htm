<h1>2016 Sutliff Bushwhacker Disc Golf League Rules</h1>
<br>
<ol id="lefty">
<li>League play is intended for fun, the love of the game and friendly competition, respectively.</li>
<li><b>Entry Fee:</b> $80.00/person. Dues must be paid on sign up night (4/6/16). <u><b>NO PAY- NO PLAY!</u></b></li>
<li><b>Time:</b> Wednesdays, starting by <b>6:00 PM</b>. Please be courteous to ALL other players and park users.  Please be early or on time. If you can't be on time, please contact your partner or opponents and don't begin on a hole that may cause slower play by other groups.</li>
<li><b>Format:</b> Each week partners will play opponents head to head for 3 pts., best avg. vs. best avg. and 2nd best avg. vs. 2nd best avg. plus/minus handicaps for 1 point each. A third point will be awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative score after handicap. Ties will result in 1/2 point awarded to each player and/or team.  <u><b>Please keep groups to a max of 4 players.</u></b>
<li><b>Draft Night:</b> After sign up night the Rules Committee will meet to randomly choose draft position for each player.  Players draw for their partner in order of draft position at Parlor City Bar on Wednesday, April 13th, beginning at 6 pm.  Players will have 5 minutes from their draft time to draw.  If a player is unable to draw within the given time frame, a Rules Committee member will draw for them.  Ask Woody if any questions.
<li><b>Handicap:</b> We will use an 80% handicap based off of a score of 46. Handicaps will be set by last year's handicap for the first round. The second round handicap will be set by the average of last year's handicap and the first round. Subsequent rounds will be based on your average for all rounds this year. New players and subs will need two weeks to set a handicap; however, a subs first round will be counted scratch.</li>
<li><b>Cancellations: <u>Plan to play no matter what!</u></b> The Rules Committee will have the final say on cancelling a league event. If cancelled, the rules committee will schedule a make-up round. If weather is going to occur during the round, the rules committee will decide an appropriate and safe course of action.</li>
<li><b>Absences:</b> If you are unable to play on Wednesday night, you should:
<ol >
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Contact your partner</li>
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Make-up the round at 10 AM the following Sunday at the same venue</li>
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Find a sub</li>
</ol>
If no sub plays on Wednesday, and you don't make up the round on Sunday, <b><u>YOU WILL FORFIET YOUR POINTS!</b></u> If you miss league <b>TWICE (no call/no show)</b>, you may be removed from your team at the discretion of the Rules Committee. If your partner drops for any reason, the Rules Committee will pair you with the next most established sub.</li>
<li><b>Subs:</b> You or your partner must be responsible for finding/choosing a sub <i>and</i> <u>making sure a league administrator knows of the substitution</u>. <u>Subs must pay $5.00 at some point on league night for their round to be scored</u>. Subs may become members of league at a prorated cost making them eligible for prizes, ace fund, party, etc. <u><b>Extra subs must play on a sub card. No groups larger than 4 players.</u></b></li>
<li><b>Church/Sunday Make-up:</b> There will be a limit of 4 Church rounds per player. Extra Church rounds will be dealt with on a case by case basis by the Rules Committee. Church starts promptly at 10 AM. At 10:15 if you're not there, <u><b>you will forfeit your points and no score will be counted</u></b>. Subs cannot play for an individual or team score on Sunday, however, they can pay to have their score kept and handicap figured. Players who miss Wednesday and got a Sub can play Church for yearly/career stats but no points. If a conflict arises (e.g. a tournament takes over the course on Sunday and the round can't be played or you're playing in a tournament at the make-up course) you may make arrangements to make up the round with Rules Committee approval.</li>
<li><b>Honors/Tees/Alternate Tees:</b> The score card will dictate order for the first hole. Honors, group discretion, or speed of play may all be used during the round. We play all long tees at every course when possible. At the group's consensus, if the original tee is unsafe or unusable, use of an alternate tee is permitted as long as it's no closer to the hole.</li>
<li><b>Finishing a Hole:</b> The disc must be at rest in the basket or hanging in the chains to be completed. Resting on top or hanging from any exterior part of the basket doesn't count as completed. Any wedged disc will count as long as it is retrieved from the basket before falling out.  “Gimme” putts may be offered by opposing team members only. <b><u>ALWAYS PLAN TO PUTT OUT!</b></u></li>
<li><b>Out of Bounds:</b> There will be no out of bounds. If stuck in a tree, play from beneath it. There will be no taking a stroke to get out of a jam, play from where it lies. If in water, refer to rule 15B.</li>
<li><b>Scoring:</b> Members are required to pay attention to their opponents score hole by hole. Disputes will be settled by the group's consensus, OR refer to rule 15D.</li>
<li><b>Penalty Strokes:</b> All stroke penalties will be given at the group's consensus.</li>
<ol style="padding-left:30" type="A">
<li><i>Lost Disc</i> – One stroke penalty. There will be a max of 5 minutes, timed by the group, to search for a lost disc. Please reference the notable course etiquette.  Be aware of your group's throws and spot if necessary. Play will resume from as close to the previous spot as possible. If the disc is lost off the tee, re-tee.</li>
<li><i>Water Hazard</i> – If you throw into water, you can:

<h2>Bushwhacker Cup Match Play Tournament</h2><br>
<p>
At the conclusion of the regular Bushwhacker league season there will be a single elimination, seeded, individual match play tournament where players will play head to head with their handicap.<br><br>
Seeds will be based off of an individual's total points earned during the regular league season.  If there were to be multiple players with the same amount of total points, their year's average will be the tie breaker with the lower average getting the higher seed.  Seed numbers will be dictated by attendance.  An example of seeds would be 1-16, with 1 being the highest and 16 being lowest.<br><br>
In the event where there’s three on a card, elimination rules will take into effect, there will be no byes into future rounds. You must play to be able to advance.<br><br>
Entry fee is $5.00 and included  in league dues  with 100% payout to the top 3 to 4 players.<br><br>
All league rules will apply.  Handicap will adjust accordingly.<br><br>
Rounds will be each Wednesday following league and plan to start as close to 5:30 pm as daylight is an issue this late in the year.<br><br>
If you win each match the tournament should only take 4-5 weeks depending on format.<br><br>
The Champion gets his/her name on the Bushwhacker Cup trophy and their choice of drink which they will consume from the cup at the following years league party.<br><br>
