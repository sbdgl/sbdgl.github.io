<h1>2018 Sutliff Bushwhacker Disc Golf League Rules</h1>
<br>
<ol id="lefty">
<li>League play is intended for fun, the love of the game and friendly competition, respectively.</li>
<li><b>Entry Fee:</b> $80.00/person. Dues must be paid on sign up night. <u><b>NO PAY- NO PLAY!</u></b></li>
<li><b>Time: 6:00 PM on Wednesdays</b>. If you can¿t be on time, please contact your partner or opponents and don¿t begin on a hole that may cause slower play by other groups.  If your whole card is present go ahead and begin at any time prior to 6:00.</li>
<li><b>Format:</b> Each week partners will play opponents head to head for 3 pts., best avg. vs. best avg. and 2nd best avg. vs. 2nd best avg. plus/minus handicaps for 1 point each. A third point will be awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative score after handicap. Ties will result in 1/2 point awarded to each player and/or team.  <u><b>Please keep groups to a max of 4 players unless OK'd by group consensus.</u></b></li>
<li><b>Draft Night:</b> After sign up night the Rules Committee will meet to randomly choose draft position for each player.  Players draw for their partner in order of draft position.  Players will have 5 minutes from their draft time to draw.  If a player is unable to draw within the given time frame, a Rules Committee member will draw for them.</li>
<li><b>Handicap:</b> We will use an 80% handicap based off of a score of 46.  Handicaps will begin with last year¿s final three rounds. The second and third round handicap will be set by dropping the oldest round. Subsequent rounds will be based on your average for the three most recent rounds.  New players and subs will need three weeks to set a handicap; however, a sub¿s round will be counted scratch until a handicap (3 scored rounds) is established.  Rounds from the previous year will count. </li>
<li><b>Cancellations: <u>Plan to play no matter what!</u></b> The Rules Committee will have the final say on cancelling a league event. If cancelled, the rules committee will schedule a make-up round. If weather is going to occur during the round, the rules committee will decide an appropriate and safe course of action.</li>
<li><b>Absences:</b> If you are unable to play on Wednesday night, you should:
<ol >
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Contact your partner</li>
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Make-up the round at 10 AM the following Sunday at the same venue</li>
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Find a sub</li>
</ol>
If no sub plays on Wednesday, and you don't make up the round on Sunday, <b><u>YOU WILL FORFIET YOUR POINTS!</b></u> If you miss league <b>TWICE (no call/no show)</b>, you may be removed from your team at the discretion of the Rules Committee. If your partner drops for any reason, the Rules Committee will pair you with the next most established sub.</li>
<li><b>Subs:</b> You or your partner must be responsible for finding/choosing a sub <i>and</i> <u>making sure a league administrator knows of the substitution</u>. <u>Subs must pay $5.00 for their round to be scored</u>. <u><b>Extra subs must play on a sub card. No groups larger than 4 players unless OK'd by group consensus (see rule 4).</u></b></li>
<li><b>"Church" aka Make-up Rounds:</b> There will be a limit of 3 Church rounds per player. Your 4th and any subsequent Church round will not count unless decided upon by the entire Rules Committee. Church rounds start Sunday promptly at 10 AM at the weekly scheduled course. At 10:15 if you're not there, <u><b>you will forfeit your points and no score will be counted</u></b>. Subs cannot play for an individual or team score on Sunday, however, they can pay $5.00 to have their score kept and handicap figured. Players who miss Wednesday and got a Sub can play Church for career stats but no points. <b>If a conflict arises where you absolutely cannot play on Wednesday, you MAY be able to make arrangements to make up your round. Contact ALL MEMBERS of The Rules Committee for details. This is a Wednesday league so plan accordingly.</b></li>
<li><b>Honors/Tees/Alternate Tees:</b> The score card will dictate order for the first hole. Honors, group discretion, or speed of play may all be used during the round. At the group's consensus, if the original tee is unsafe or unusable, use of an alternate tee is permitted as long as it's no closer to the hole.</li>
<li><b>Finishing a Hole:</b> The disc must be at rest in the basket, hanging in the chains, or be hanging vertically from any exterior part to be completed. Resting on top of the basket doesn't count as completed. Any wedged or hanging disc will count as long as it is retrieved from the basket before falling out/off.  “Gimme” putts may be offered by opposing team members only. <b><u>ALWAYS PLAN TO PUTT OUT!</b></u></li>
<li><b>Out of Bounds:</b> There will be no out of bounds. Play from where it lies. If in water, refer to rule 15B.</li>
<li><b>Scoring:</b> Members are required to pay attention to their opponents score hole by hole. Disputes will be settled by the group's consensus, OR refer to rule 15D. As stats come out check them and report any mistakes before start of play the following week.</li>
<li><b>Penalty Strokes:</b> All stroke penalties will be given at the group's consensus.</li>
<ol style="padding-left:30" type="A">
<li><i>Lost Disc</i> – One stroke penalty. There will be a max of 5 minutes, timed by the group, to search for a lost disc. Please reference the notable course etiquette.  Be aware of your group's throws and spot if necessary. Play will resume from as close to the previous spot as possible. If the disc is lost off the tee, re-tee.</li>
<li><i>Water Hazard</i> – If you throw into water, you can:
<ol >
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Play from your lie in the water for no penalty</li>
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Play from the point of entry into the water for a one stroke penalty</li>
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:8px;">Play from the previous throws lie for a one stroke penalty</li>
</ol></li>

</ol>
<li><b>Hobo Rule:</b> If any non-league person or animal picks up, moves, and/or affects your lie get group consensus on a new lie as close as possible to the original. No penalty shall be assessed. If moved by a league member refer to Rule 15C</li>
<li><b>Tied Team Records at End of Season:</b> In the event of a tie, team points will be the tiebreaker. If that were to be tied too, team average will be the next tie breaker. If you're not happy with your team average... Fucking shoot better!</li>

<h2>Bushwhacker Cup Match Play Tournament</h2><br>
<p>
At the conclusion of the regular Bushwhacker league season there will be a single elimination, seeded, individual match play tournament where players will play head to head with their handicap.<br><br>
Seeds will be based off of an individual's total points earned during the regular league season.  If there were to be multiple players with the same amount of total points, their year's average will be the tie breaker with the lower average getting the higher seed.  Seed numbers will be dictated by attendance.  An example of seeds would be 1-16, with 1 being the highest and 16 being lowest.<br><br>
In the event where there’s three on a card, elimination rules will take into effect, there will be no byes into future rounds. You must play to be able to advance.<br><br>
Entry fee is $5.00 and included  in league dues  with 100% payout to the top 3 to 4 players.<br><br>
