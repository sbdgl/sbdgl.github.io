<h1>2014 Sutliff Bushwhacker Disc Golf League Rules</h1>
<br>
<ol id="lefty">
<li>League play is intended for fun, the love of the game and friendly competition, respectively.</li>
<li>Partners will be chosen by random draw at Shuey’s Bar on Wednesday, April 9th, at 6 pm.</li>
<li><b>Entry Fee:</b> $75.00/person. Dues must be paid on sign up night. <u><b>NO PAY- NO PLAY!</u></b></li>
<li><b>Readiness:</b> A minimum of two discs is required for league play. All players must uniquely mark their discs.</li>
<li><b>Time:</b> Wednesdays, starting <i>by</i> <b>6:00 PM</b>. Please be courteous to other players, be early or on time. If you can’t, please contact your partner/opponents and don’t begin on a hole that may cause slower play by other groups.</li>
<li><b>Format:</b> Each week, partners will play opponents head to head for 3 pts., best avg. vs. best avg. and 2nd best avg. vs. 2nd best avg. plus/minus handicaps for 1 point each. A third point will be awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative score after handicap. Ties will result in ½ point awarded to each player and/or team.</li>
<li><b>Handicap:</b> We will use an 80% handicap based off of a score of 46. Handicaps will be set by last year’s handicap for the first round. The second round handicap will be set by the average of last year’s handicap and the first round. Subsequent rounds will be based on your average for all rounds this year. New players and subs will need two weeks to set a handicap; however, a subs first round will be counted scratch.</li>
<li><b>Cancellations: <u>Plan to play no matter what!</u></b> The Rules Committee will have the final say on cancelling a league event. If cancelled, the rules committee will schedule a make-up round. If weather is going to occur during the round, the rules committee will decide an appropriate and safe course of action.</li>
<li><b>Absences:</b> If you are unable to play on Wednesday night, you should:
<ol >
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Contact your partner</li>
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Make-up the round at 10 AM the following Sunday at the same venue</li>
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Find a sub</li>
</ol>
If no sub plays on Wednesday, and you don’t make up the round on Sunday, <b><u>YOU WILL FORFIET YOUR POINTS!</b></u> If you miss league <b>TWICE (no call/no show)</b>, you may be removed from your team at your partner's discretion with full support of the Rules Committee. If your partner drops for any reason, the Rules Committee will pair you with the next most established sub.</li>
<li><b>Subs:</b> You or your partner must be responsible for finding/choosing a sub <i>and</i> <u>making sure a league administrator knows of the substitution</u>. <u>Subs must pay $5.00 at some point on league night for their round to be scored</u>. Subs may become members of league at a prorated cost making them eligible for prizes, ace fund, party, etc.</li>
<li><b>Church/Sunday Make-up:</b> There will be a limit of 4 Church rounds per player. Extra Church rounds will be dealt with on a case by case basis by the Rules Committee. Church starts promptly at 10 AM. At 10:15 if you’re not there, <u>you will forfeit your points and no score will be counted</u>. Subs cannot play for an individual or team score on Sunday, however, they can pay to have their score kept and handicap figured. Everyone is encouraged to play church.</li>
<li><b>Honors:</b> Honors will be used for shooting order at all times. The score card will dictate order for the first hole.</li>
<li><b>Tees/Alternate tees:</b> We play all long tees at every course when possible. At group’s consensus, if original tee is unsafe or unusable, use of an alternate tee is permitted as long as it’s no closer to the hole.</li>
<li><b>Finishing a Hole:</b> The disc must be at rest in the basket or hanging in the chains to be completed. Resting on top or hanging from any exterior part of the basket doesn’t count as completed. In case of a wedged disc, only if the shot was blind (unseen) or wedged from the inside will it count. Wedges clearly seen and from the outside will not. Gimmies may be offered by opposing team members only, always plan to putt out.</li>
<li><b>Out of Bounds:</b> There will be no out of bounds. If stuck in a tree, play from beneath it. There will be no taking a stroke to get out of a jam, play from where it lies. If in water, refer to rule 17B.</li>
<li><b>Scoring:</b> Members are required to pay attention to their opponents score hole by hole. Disputes will be settled by group’s consensus, OR refer to rule 17D.</li>
<li><b>Penalty Strokes:</b> All stroke penalties will be given at group’s consensus.</li>
<ol style="padding-left:30" type="A">
<li><i>Lost Disc</i> – One Stroke Penalty. There will be a limit of 5 minutes to search for a lost disc. Time will be kept by the next (waiting) group on the hole. Be aware of your group’s throws and spot if necessary. Play will resume from as close to the previous spot as possible. If disc is lost off the tee, re-tee.</li>
<li><i>Water Hazard</i> – If you throw into water, you can:
<ol >
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Play from your lie in the water for no penalty</li>
