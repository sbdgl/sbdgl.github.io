<h1>2021 Sutliff Bushwhacker Disc Golf League Rules</h1>
<br>
<ol id="lefty">
<li>League play is intended for fun, the love of the game and friendly competition, respectively.</li>
  <li><b>Entry Fee:</b> $80.00/person. Dues must be paid on sign up night. <u><b>NO PAY- NO PLAY! If you quit or are removed from league there are NO REFUNDS and you will not be invited back.</u></b></li>
<li><b>Time: 6:00 PM on Wednesdays</b>. If you can't be on time, please contact your partner or opponents and don't begin on a hole that may cause slower play by other groups.  If your whole card is present before 6:00, please start.</li>
<li><b>Format:</b> Each week partners will play opponents head to head for 3 pts., best avg. vs. best avg. and 2nd best avg. vs. 2nd best avg. plus/minus handicaps for 1 point each. A third point will be awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative score after handicap. Ties will result in 1/2 point awarded to each player and/or team.  <u><b>Please keep groups to a max of 4 players unless OK'd by group consensus.</u></b></li>
<li><b>Draft Night:</b> Via Facebook Live on Wednesday April 7th at 8 PM. a member of the Rules Committee will draw for each player in no particular order and teams will be paired accordingly.  Any questions ask D. Burns.</li>
<li><b>Handicap:</b> We will use an 80% handicap based off of a score of 46.  Handicaps will be set by last year’s handicap for the first round. The second round handicap will be set by the average of last year’s handicap and the first round. Subsequent rounds will be based on your average for all rounds this year.  New players and subs will need two weeks to set a handicap; however, a sub's first round will be counted scratch.</li>
<li><b>Cancellations: <u>Plan to play no matter what!</u></b> The Rules Committee will have the final say on cancelling a league event. If cancelled, the rules committee will schedule a make-up round. If weather is going to occur during the round, the rules committee will decide an appropriate and safe course of action.</li>
<li><b>Absences:</b> If you are unable to play on Wednesday night, you should:
<ol >
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Contact your partner</li>
<li style="margin-left:50px;padding-bottom:2px;">Find a sub</li>
</ol>
If you or a sub does not play on Wednesday, <b><u>YOU WILL FORFEIT YOUR POINTS!</b></u> If you miss league <b>TWICE (no call/no show)</b>, you may be removed from your team at the discretion of the Rules Committee. If your partner drops for any reason, the Rules Committee will pair you with the next most established sub. <u><b>Communicate!</b></u></li>

<h2>Bushwhacker Cup Match Play Tournament</h2><br>
<p>
At the conclusion of the regular Bushwhacker league season there will be a single elimination, seeded, individual match play tournament where players will play head to head with their Jones handicap.<br><br>
Seeds will be based off of an individual’s total points earned during the regular league season.  If there were to be multiple players with the same amount of total points, their year’s average will be the tie breaker with the lower average getting the higher seed.  An example of seeds would be 1-16, with 1 being the highest and 16 being lowest.<br><br>
Entry fee is $5.00 and included in league dues with 100% payout to the top 3 to 4 players.  This has been paid in your $80.00 league dues.  Side betting is encouraged!<br><br>
All league rules will apply.  Handicap will adjust accordingly.<br><br>
Rounds will be each Wednesday following league and plan to start as close to 5:30 pm as daylight is an issue this late in the year.<br><br>
If you win each match the tournament should only take 4-5 weeks depending on format.<br><br>
The Champion gets his/her name on the Bushwhacker Cup trophy and their choice of drink which they will consume from the cup at the following years league party.<br><br>
